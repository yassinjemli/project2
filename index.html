<h1 id="yasne">Elliot</h1>
          <p id="ysne">Elliot Alderson is a former cybersecurity engineer of Allsafe Cybersecurity and a member of fsociety. He is played by
          Rami Malek.
          
          Elliot suffers from social anxiety disorder, clinical depression, delusions and paranoia. His internal life is revealed
          via voice-overs that provide insight into his mental state, his opinions of the people he encounters and the activity
          around him. These dialogues with the audience are designed to help us interpret Elliot's world, but given his mental
          illness,
          <p> he is an unreliable narrator, leaving us unsure whether what he tells us we're seeing is actually what is
          happening. Typical of this is when Elliot hears everyone around him refer to E Corp as Evil Corp, reflecting his own
          opinion of the conglomerate.</p>

          <h1 id="y">Mr. Robot</h1>
          <p id="yassin">Mr. Robot is the co-founder and leader of the hacker group fsociety, a revolutionary prophet who plans to bring down the
          world's largest conglomerate. Though he is intelligent and charismatic, Mr. Robot is also emotionally manipulative, and
          can be quick to turn violent.

<h1 id="ang2">Angela Moss</h1>
<p id="ang">Angela was born on February 27, 1988, in New Jersey to Phillip Price and Emily Moss, but Emily refused to be with
Phillip, instead choosing to marry Donald Moss, who became her adopted father. She is an only child. Her mother died as
a result of the Washington Township leak of 1993. In the aftermath, she became friends with Darlene and Elliot Alderson,
with whom she shared a love for the book From the Mixed-Up Files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler. Angela fondly remembers
wanting to be like Claudia Kincaid, the story's adventurous heroine. She also remembers the Aldersons subjecting her to
their favorite movie, The Careful Massacre of the Bourgeoisie, every Halloween.

<h1 id="ty">Tyrell Wellick</h1>
<p id="typ">Tyrell Wellick was born in Västra Götalands län, Sweden. His father knew very little English, but took great pride in
his ability to recite a poem by William Carlos Williams: "So much depends on a red wheelbarrow glazed with rainwater
beside the white chickens." Later in life, he would come to hate his father and fear becoming him.
